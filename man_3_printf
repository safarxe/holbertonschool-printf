.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf()
function writes output to the standard output stream,
.BR stdout,
under the control of a
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.PP
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
characters (not
.B %
), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent
arguments. Each conversion specification begins with the character
.B %
and ends with a conversion specifier.
.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The following conversion specifiers are supported:
.TP
.B c
Prints a single character.
.TP
.B s
Prints a string of characters. If the argument is NULL, it prints "(null)".
.TP
.B d, i
Prints a signed decimal integer.
.TP
.B %
A
.B %
is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion
specification is
.BR %%.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, the
.B _printf()
function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the
null byte used to end output to strings).
